## 📝 Game Description (2-5 sentences)

You wake up in the same room. Again. Trapped in an endless time loop, you must find the differences in your reality before time runs out. Each day the room changes—objects shift, fade, and distort as your memories fracture. Built with Phaser, featuring 3 difficulty modes, 8 achievements, and 4 different endings based on your performance. Can you break free, or will you loop forever?
