## 🏆 COMPETITION SUBMISSION TEXT (Copy/Paste)

**Game Title:** Day 7: Deja Vu

**Game Link:** https://sujaltripathi.github.io/day7-deja-vu/

**Description:**
You wake up in the same room. Again. Trapped in an endless time loop, you must find the differences in your reality before time runs out. Each day the room changes—objects shift, fade, and distort as your memories fracture. Built with Phaser, featuring 3 difficulty modes, 8 achievements, and 4 different endings based on your performance. Can you break free, or will you loop forever?

**Theme Implementation:**
Time loops are the core mechanic. Players relive the same day repeatedly while objects deteriorate, representing memory decay. The countdown timer creates urgency, and the narrative explores being trapped in time.
